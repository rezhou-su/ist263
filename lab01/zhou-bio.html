<body>
My name is Renhai Zhou. I am under Apply Mathematics major at Syracuse Art and Science college, I am really interested in game design, so I am trying my best to transfer to computer science. I was a team member of my high school FTC robotic team. With the help from other team members, I lead us to first place in the California Regional Competition. I used to help wild animals in Africa and was able to give a presentation in front of crowds and got interviewed by the local TV station. I am also very good at cooking food. I believe I am a very outgoing guy. According to my friendsâ€™ opinion, I am also very nice. I like sports, such as football and boxing. I also like gaming. The list of my game includes League of Legends, Call of Duty, Overwatch, Apex, Valorant, etc. I like pop music and my one and only favorite star is Lady Gaga. I am glad if we can be friend if possible. Hope we can have fun together.
