    <h1>Renhai's Biography</h1>
    <p>

        I was a team member of my high school FTC robotic team. With the help from other team members, I lead us to first place in the California Regional Competition. I used to help wild animals in Africa and was able to give a presentation in front of crowds and got interviewed by the local TV station. I am also very good at cooking food.

The list of my game includes League of Legends, Call of Duty, Overwatch, Apex, Valorant, etc. I like pop music and my one and only favorite star are ,<strong>Lady Gaga</strong>.
