            <h1>History of Horror Games</h1>
            <p>The known first horror video game in the world is Killer Shark launched in 1972. The gameplay was just simply fighting a giant shark with a firing light gun. Even though its graphic and gameplay were very crude, Killer Shark is still a great start for horror games and made people realize there is more to expect in such game categories. By the lunch of the Atari 2600 game console, the game hunted house was released in the 1980s. unfortunately, the game itself was rather stupid than scary. Players, represented by a set of eyes, had to wander around a house in the dark collecting items and constantly bumping into things. But it was a great start and boost for horror game development. Later, the game Halloween released in 1983 was more successful due to its great performance in the scary scenes by only using an 8-bit rendition. And so on, the gate of the horror game is opened.</p>

            <h1>What Makes a Horror Game Turely Scary</h1>
            <p>The most obvious ones that all horror buffs cite as the most important agents of fear: the unknown, and frights. Possibly the most obvious horror element, the unknown is used to keep the player guessing and their mind going wild. The second one is the scare out of your skin. Most jump scares are the direct way a horror game used to scare players. It is a cheap scare. Cheap scares work on the weak of heart, but the average horror gamer has cojones of steel and expects monsters to jump out of dark corners. These types of scares are at the bottom of the barrel. The third one is anticipation. The only thing more terrifying than not knowing what to expect around the next corner is having a vague idea of what it is. Last but not the least, dazed and confused. Anticipation goes so well with the element of confusion. Playing with a character’s anticipation is not always entirely effective, especially if it’s consistent. The minute a player catches on to the fact that a given ghost or horrifying denizen of the game is no longer an actual threat, the player’s fears drop away like onion layers.</p>
